1. Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
2. Click **"New Project"** → **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
3. Select `The-Daily-Dribble---Solo-Project`
4. Go to **Variables** tab and add:

```env
# Required Variables (copy and paste)
GMAIL_CLIENT_ID=your_gmail_client_id
GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_gmail_client_secret
GMAIL_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
CELLPEX_USERNAME=your_cellpex_username
CELLPEX_PASSWORD=your_cellpex_password
```

5. Click **Deploy**

### 3. Test Your Deployment

Once deployed, get your URL and test:

```bash
# Health check
curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/

# Test Cellpex with anti-hallucination
curl -X POST https://your-app.up.railway.app/test/enhanced-2fa/cellpex \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "category": "Apple > iPhone",
    "brand": "Apple", 
    "model": "iPhone 14 Pro",
    "available_quantity": 5,
    "price": 899.99,
    "comments": "Brand new",
    "remarks": "Fast shipping"
  }'
```

## What You Get

🛡️ **Anti-Hallucination**: Bot will never claim false success
🔍 **Vision Analysis**: Uses o4-mini-high for page understanding  
📧 **2FA Support**: Automatic Gmail integration
🚀 **Production Ready**: Chrome works perfectly on Railway
📊 **Full Logging**: See exactly what the bot is doing

## Alternative: Use Deployment Script

```bash
# Set your credentials first
export GMAIL_CLIENT_ID="your_id"
export GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET="your_secret"
export GMAIL_REFRESH_TOKEN="your_token"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_key"
export CELLPEX_USERNAME="your_username"
export CELLPEX_PASSWORD="your_password"

# Run deployment
./deploy_to_railway.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

**Chrome Issues?** 
- Railway handles Chrome automatically - no local setup needed!

**OAuth Issues?**
- Run `python standalone_oauth_completion.py` locally to get refresh token

**Can't see logs?**
- Use `railway logs` or check Railway dashboard

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. ✅ Verify anti-hallucination is working (check logs)
2. ✅ Test a real listing on Cellpex
3. ⏭️ Add other platforms (GSM, Kardof, etc.)
4. ⏭️ Set up scheduled runs
