Context: I need to fill a form field with the following information:
Field type: text
Field name: Price
Value to enter: 999.99

Please analyze the screenshot and tell me:
1. Can you see this field?
2. Is it a dropdown, text input, or autocomplete?
3. The exact selector to use
4. Any special steps needed (like clicking to open dropdown first)
