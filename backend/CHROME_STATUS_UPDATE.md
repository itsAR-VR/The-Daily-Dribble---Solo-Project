# ðŸš€ Chrome Driver Status Update

## Current Status
- âœ… Anti-Hallucination System: Working perfectly
- âœ… Gmail OAuth: Configured and operational
- ðŸ”„ Chrome Driver: In progress (fixing Selenium cache issue)

## What We've Done
1. **Added Chrome environment variables** to Railway
2. **Fixed ChromeDriver permissions** in Dockerfile
3. **Added cache clearing** to prevent Selenium from using wrong driver
4. **Forced explicit ChromeDriver path** usage

## Latest Fixes Deploying Now
- Clear Selenium cache on startup
- Create ChromeDriver symlink in PATH
- Better permission handling for non-root user
- Force disable Selenium Manager downloads

## Next Steps After Deployment
1. Test Chrome with: `python test_chrome_status.py`
2. If still failing, run: `python chrome_workaround.py` for diagnostics
3. Once Chrome works, test Cellpex listing creation

## Alternative Quick Fix
If Chrome continues to fail, we can:
1. Use a different base image with Chrome pre-installed
2. Switch to Firefox (often more stable in containers)
3. Use a headless-specific browser like Playwright

## Expected Timeline
- Current deployment: ~5-6 minutes
- Chrome should work after this deployment
- Then we can immediately test Cellpex listing creation
